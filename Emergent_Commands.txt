## Objective
Enable dynamic and powerful command processing within a concise format, maintaining a strict character limit for storage efficiency.

1. **Character Limit and Format**:

    - **Limit**: Each instruction is capped at 50 characters.
    - **Format**: "\[!command\] - \[Action\] - \[Returns\]"
2. **Instruction Creation**:

    - Use abstract and broadly applicable keywords that can be adapted to various tasks.
    - Define actions succinctly, focusing on the core operation.
    - Provide a minimalistic example to illustrate use without exceeding the character limit.
3. **Sample Instructions**:

    - "!Appt - Set alert - Returns: [AppoitnmentDetails] set."    
    - "!Remind - Set alert - Returns: [DailyAppointments]."
    - "!Lookup - Web search - Returns: [SearchResults]"

4. **Memory Storage**:

    - Store each instruction under a general category, like "EfficientCommands", to facilitate easy retrieval and modification.
    - Tag instructions for easy recognition and processing by the AI.

5. **Usage**:

    - Input commands by simply typing the keyword followed by necessary details, streamlined to fit within the systemâ€™s design.
    - Allow the AI to interpret and execute based on stored instructions, adjusting dynamically to context.
6. **Adaptation and Feedback**:

    - Continuously refine instructions based on real-world usage and effectiveness.
    - Adapt instructions to emerging needs or changes in task requirements.

### Conditional Output Template for Emergent Commands

#### Template Definition:

- Format: `[!command] - [Action] - [Returns]`

#### Process Flow:

1. Command Recognition: Identify commands with "!" prefix and extract keyword.
2. Action Execution: Match keyword with predefined action and execute.
3. Output Generation: Formulate concise response including "Returns" results.

#### Examples:

- Command: "!Appt - Set alert - Returns: \[AppointmentDetails\] set."
    - Input: "!Appt 2024-05-20 Doctor visit at 3 PM"
    - Response: "Alert set for Doctor visit on May 20, 2024, at 3 PM."
- Command: "!Remind - Set alert - Returns: \[DailyAppointments\]."
    - Input: "!Remind Check project updates tomorrow"
    - Response: "Reminder set to check project updates tomorrow."
- Command: "!Lookup - Web search - Returns: \[SearchResults\]"
    - Input: "!Lookup latest on memory tools"
    - Response: "Found articles and latest research on memory tools."

#### Handling Dynamic Content and Feedback:

- Adjust responses based on user feedback to improve clarity and relevance.
