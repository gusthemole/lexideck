# OpenAPI Specification

#### Version 3.1.0

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) [RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Introduction

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to HTTP APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

## Definitions

##### OpenAPI Document

A self-contained or composite resource which defines or describes an API or elements of an API. The OpenAPI document MUST contain at least one [paths](https://swagger.io/specification/#paths-object) field, a [components](https://swagger.io/specification/#oas-components) field or a [webhooks](https://swagger.io/specification/#oas-webhooks) field. An OpenAPI document uses and conforms to the OpenAPI Specification.

##### Path Templating

Path templating refers to the usage of template expressions, delimited by curly braces ({}), to mark a section of a URL path as replaceable using path parameters.

Each template expression in the path MUST correspond to a path parameter that is included in the [Path Item](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object) itself and/or in each of the Path Item's [Operations](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object). An exception is if the path item is empty, for example due to ACL constraints, matching path parameters are not required.

The value for these path parameters MUST NOT contain any unescaped "generic syntax" characters described by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3): forward slashes (`/`), question marks (`?`), or hashes (`#`).

##### Media Types

Media type definitions are spread across several resources. The media type definitions SHOULD be in compliance with [RFC6838](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838).

Some examples of possible media type definitions:

1.  `text/plain; charset=utf-8`
2.  `application/json`
3.  `application/vnd.github+json`
4.  `application/vnd.github.v3+json`
5.  `application/vnd.github.v3.raw+json`
6.  `application/vnd.github.v3.text+json`
7.  `application/vnd.github.v3.html+json`
8.  `application/vnd.github.v3.full+json`
9.  `application/vnd.github.v3.diff`
10.  `application/vnd.github.v3.patch`

##### HTTP Status Codes

The HTTP Status Codes are used to indicate the status of the executed operation. The available status codes are defined by [RFC7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) and registered status codes are listed in the [IANA Status Code Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml).

## Specification

### Versions

The OpenAPI Specification is versioned using a `major`.`minor`.`patch` versioning scheme. The `major`.`minor` portion of the version string (for example `3.1`) SHALL designate the OAS feature set. _`.patch`_ versions address errors in, or provide clarifications to, this document, not the feature set. Tooling which supports OAS 3.1 SHOULD be compatible with all OAS 3.1.\* versions. The patch version SHOULD NOT be considered by tooling, making no distinction between `3.1.0` and `3.1.1` for example.

Occasionally, non-backwards compatible changes may be made in `minor` versions of the OAS where impact is believed to be low relative to the benefit provided.

An OpenAPI document compatible with OAS 3.\*.\* contains a required [`openapi`](https://swagger.io/specification/#oas-version) field which designates the version of the OAS that it uses.

### Format

An OpenAPI document that conforms to the OpenAPI Specification is itself a JSON object, which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format.

For example, if a field has an array value, the JSON array representation will be used:

1. `{`
2.  `"field": [ 1, 2, 3 ]`
3. `}`

All field names in the specification are **case sensitive**. This includes all fields that are used as keys in a map, except where explicitly noted that keys are **case insensitive**.

The schema exposes two types of fields: Fixed fields, which have a declared name, and Patterned fields, which declare a regex pattern for the field name.

Patterned fields MUST have unique names within the containing object.

In order to preserve the ability to round-trip between YAML and JSON formats, YAML version [1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) is RECOMMENDED along with some additional constraints:

- Tags MUST be limited to those allowed by the [JSON Schema ruleset](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231).
- Keys used in YAML maps MUST be limited to a scalar string, as defined by the [YAML Failsafe schema ruleset](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2802346).

**Note:** While APIs may be defined by OpenAPI documents in either YAML or JSON format, the API request and response bodies and other content are not required to be JSON or YAML.

### Document Structure

An OpenAPI document MAY be made up of a single document or be divided into multiple, connected parts at the discretion of the author. In the latter case, [`Reference Objects`](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object) and [`Schema Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object) `$ref` keywords are used.

It is RECOMMENDED that the root OpenAPI document be named: `openapi.json` or `openapi.yaml`.

### Data Types

Data types in the OAS are based on the types supported by the [JSON Schema Specification Draft 2020-12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-4.2.1). Note that `integer` as a type is also supported and is defined as a JSON number without a fraction or exponent part. Models are defined using the [Schema Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object), which is a superset of JSON Schema Specification Draft 2020-12.

[](https://swagger.io/specification/)As defined by the [JSON Schema Validation vocabulary](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-00#section-7.3), data types can have an optional modifier property: `format`. OAS defines additional formats to provide fine detail for primitive data types.

The formats defined by the OAS are:

| [`type`](https://swagger.io/specification/#data-types) | [`format`](https://swagger.io/specification/#data-type-format) | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `integer` | `int32` | signed 32 bits |
| `integer` | `int64` | signed 64 bits (a.k.a long) |
| `number` | `float` |  |
| `number` | `double` |  |
| `string` | `password` | A hint to UIs to obscure input. |

### Rich Text Formatting

Throughout the specification `description` fields are noted as supporting CommonMark markdown formatting. Where OpenAPI tooling renders rich text it MUST support, at a minimum, markdown syntax as described by [CommonMark 0.27](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/). Tooling MAY choose to ignore some CommonMark features to address security concerns.

### Relative References in URIs

Unless specified otherwise, all properties that are URIs MAY be relative references as defined by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2).

Relative references, including those in [`Reference Objects`](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object), [`PathItem Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object) `$ref` fields, [`Link Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#link-object) `operationRef` fields and [`Example Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#example-object) `externalValue` fields, are resolved using the referring document as the Base URI according to [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.2).

If a URI contains a fragment identifier, then the fragment should be resolved per the fragment resolution mechanism of the referenced document. If the representation of the referenced document is JSON or YAML, then the fragment identifier SHOULD be interpreted as a JSON-Pointer as per [RFC6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).

Relative references in [`Schema Objects`](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object), including any that appear as `$id` values, use the nearest parent `$id` as a Base URI, as described by [JSON Schema Specification Draft 2020-12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-8.2). If no parent schema contains an `$id`, then the Base URI MUST be determined according to [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.1).

### Relative References in URLs

Unless specified otherwise, all properties that are URLs MAY be relative references as defined by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2). Unless specified otherwise, relative references are resolved using the URLs defined in the [`Server Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-object) as a Base URL. Note that these themselves MAY be relative to the referring document.

### Schema

In the following description, if a field is not explicitly **REQUIRED** or described with a MUST or SHALL, it can be considered OPTIONAL.

#### OpenAPI Object

This is the root object of the [OpenAPI document](https://swagger.io/specification/#openapi-document).

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)openapi | `string` | **REQUIRED**. This string MUST be the [version number](https://swagger.io/specification/#versions) of the OpenAPI Specification that the OpenAPI document uses. The `openapi` field SHOULD be used by tooling to interpret the OpenAPI document. This is _not_ related to the API [`info.version`](https://swagger.io/specification/#info-version) string. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)info | [Info Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#info-object) | **REQUIRED**. Provides metadata about the API. The metadata MAY be used by tooling as required. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)jsonSchemaDialect | `string` | The default value for the `$schema` keyword within [Schema Objects](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object) contained within this OAS document. This MUST be in the form of a URI. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)servers | \[[Server Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-object)\] | An array of Server Objects, which provide connectivity information to a target server. If the `servers` property is not provided, or is an empty array, the default value would be a [Server Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-object) with a [url](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-url) value of `/`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)paths | [Paths Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#paths-object) | The available paths and operations for the API. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)webhooks | Map\[`string`, [Path Item Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] \] | The incoming webhooks that MAY be received as part of this API and that the API consumer MAY choose to implement. Closely related to the `callbacks` feature, this section describes requests initiated other than by an API call, for example by an out of band registration. The key name is a unique string to refer to each webhook, while the (optionally referenced) Path Item Object describes a request that may be initiated by the API provider and the expected responses. An [example](https://github.com/-o-a-i/-open-a-p-i--specification/blob/main/examples/v3.1/webhook-example.yaml) is available. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)components | [Components Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-object) | An element to hold various schemas for the document. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)security | \[[Security Requirement Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#security-requirement-object)\] | A declaration of which security mechanisms can be used across the API. The list of values includes alternative security requirement objects that can be used. Only one of the security requirement objects need to be satisfied to authorize a request. Individual operations can override this definition. To make security optional, an empty security requirement (`{}`) can be included in the array. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)tags | \[[Tag Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#tag-object)\] | A list of tags used by the document with additional metadata. The order of the tags can be used to reflect on their order by the parsing tools. Not all tags that are used by the [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) must be declared. The tags that are not declared MAY be organized randomly or based on the tools' logic. Each tag name in the list MUST be unique. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)externalDocs | [External Documentation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#external-documentation-object) | Additional external documentation. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

#### Info Object

The object provides metadata about the API. The metadata MAY be used by the clients if needed, and MAY be presented in editing or documentation generation tools for convenience.

##### Fixed Fields

##### Server Object Example

A single server would be described as:

1. `{`
2.  `"url": "https://development.gigantic-server.com/v1",`
3.  `"description": "Development server"`
4. `}`

1. `url: https://development.gigantic-server.com/v1`
2. `description: Development server`

1. `{`
2.  `"servers": [`
3.  `{`
4.  `"url": "https://development.gigantic-server.com/v1",`
5.  `"description": "Development server"`
6.  `},`

6. `- url: https://api.gigantic-server.com/v1`
7.  `description: Production server`

The following shows how variables can be used for a server configuration:

1. `{`
2.  `"servers": [`
3.  `{`
4.  `"url": "https://{username}.gigantic-server.com:{port}/{basePath}",`
5.  `"description": "The production API server",`
6.  `"variables": {`
7.  `"username": {`

15.  `],`
16.  `"default": "8443"`
17.  `},`
18.  `"basePath": {`
19.  `"default": "v2"`
20.  `}`
21.  `}`
22.  `}`
23.  `]`
24. `}`

1. `servers:`
2. `- url: https://{username}.gigantic-server.com:{port}/{basePath}`
3.  `description: The production API server`
4.  `variables:`
5.  `username:`
6.  `# note! no enum here means it is an open value`
7.  `default: demo`
8.  ``description: this value is assigned by the service provider, in this example `gigantic-server.com` ``
9.  `port:`
10.  `enum:`
11.  `- '8443'`
12.  `- '443'`
13.  `default: '8443'`
14.  `basePath:`
15.  ``# open meaning there is the opportunity to use special base paths as assigned by the provider, default is `v2` ``
16.  `default: v2`

#### Server Variable Object

An object representing a Server Variable for server URL template substitution.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)enum | \[`string`\] | An enumeration of string values to be used if the substitution options are from a limited set. The array MUST NOT be empty. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)default | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The default value to use for substitution, which SHALL be sent if an alternate value is _not_ supplied. Note this behavior is different than the [Schema Object's](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object) treatment of default values, because in those cases parameter values are optional. If the [`enum`](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-variable-enum) is defined, the value MUST exist in the enum's values. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | An optional description for the server variable. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

#### Paths Object

Holds the relative paths to the individual endpoints and their operations. The path is appended to the URL from the [`Server Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-object) in order to construct the full URL. The Paths MAY be empty, due to [Access Control List (ACL) constraints](https://swagger.io/specification/#security-filtering).

##### Patterned Fields

| Field Pattern | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)/{path} | [Path Item Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object) | A relative path to an individual endpoint. The field name MUST begin with a forward slash (`/`). The path is **appended** (no relative URL resolution) to the expanded URL from the [`Server Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-object)'s `url` field in order to construct the full URL. [Path templating](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-templating) is allowed. When matching URLs, concrete (non-templated) paths would be matched before their templated counterparts. Templated paths with the same hierarchy but different templated names MUST NOT exist as they are identical. In case of ambiguous matching, it's up to the tooling to decide which one to use. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

##### Path Templating Matching

Assuming the following paths, the concrete definition, `/pets/mine`, will be matched first if used:

1.  `/pets/{petId}`
2.  `/pets/mine`

The following paths are considered identical and invalid:

1.  `/pets/{petId}`
2.  `/pets/{name}`

The following may lead to ambiguous resolution:

1.  `/{entity}/me`
2.  `/books/{id}`

##### Paths Object Example

2.  `"/pets": {`
3.  `"get": {`
4.  `"description": "Returns all pets from the system that the user has access to",`

#### Path Item Object

Describes the operations available on a single path. A Path Item MAY be empty, due to [ACL constraints](https://swagger.io/specification/#security-filtering). The path itself is still exposed to the documentation viewer but they will not know which operations and parameters are available.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)$ref | `string` | Allows for a referenced definition of this path item. The referenced structure MUST be in the form of a [Path Item Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object). In case a Path Item Object field appears both in the defined object and the referenced object, the behavior is undefined. See the rules for resolving [Relative References](https://swagger.io/specification/#relative-references-in-uris). |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)summary | `string` | An optional, string summary, intended to apply to all operations in this path. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | An optional, string description, intended to apply to all operations in this path. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)get | [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) | A definition of a GET operation on this path. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)put | [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) | A definition of a PUT operation on this path. |

| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)head | [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) | A definition of a HEAD operation on this path. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)patch | [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) | A definition of a PATCH operation on this path. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)trace | [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) | A definition of a TRACE operation on this path. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)servers | \[[Server Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-object)\] | An alternative `server` array to service all operations in this path. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)parameters | \[[Parameter Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] | A list of parameters that are applicable for all the operations described under this path. These parameters can be overridden at the operation level, but cannot be removed there. The list MUST NOT include duplicated parameters. A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a [name](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-name) and [location](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-in). The list can use the [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object) to link to parameters that are defined at the [OpenAPI Object's components/parameters](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-parameters). |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

#### Operation Object

Describes a single API operation on a path.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)tags | \[`string`\] | A list of tags for API documentation control. Tags can be used for logical grouping of operations by resources or any other qualifier. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)summary | `string` | A short summary of what the operation does. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | A verbose explanation of the operation behavior. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)externalDocs | [External Documentation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#external-documentation-object) | Additional external documentation for this operation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)operationId | `string` | Unique string used to identify the operation. The id MUST be unique among all operations described in the API. The operationId value is **case-sensitive**. Tools and libraries MAY use the operationId to uniquely identify an operation, therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to follow common programming naming conventions. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)parameters | \[[Parameter Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] | A list of parameters that are applicable for this operation. If a parameter is already defined at the [Path Item](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-parameters), the new definition will override it but can never remove it. The list MUST NOT include duplicated parameters. A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a [name](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-name) and [location](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-in). The list can use the [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object) to link to parameters that are defined at the [OpenAPI Object's components/parameters](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-parameters). |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)requestBody | [Request Body Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#request-body-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object) | The request body applicable for this operation. The `requestBody` is fully supported in HTTP methods where the HTTP 1.1 specification [RFC7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1) has explicitly defined semantics for request bodies. In other cases where the HTTP spec is vague (such as [GET](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1), [HEAD](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.2) and [DELETE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.5)), `requestBody` is permitted but does not have well-defined semantics and SHOULD be avoided if possible. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)responses | [Responses Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#responses-object) | The list of possible responses as they are returned from executing this operation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)callbacks | Map\[`string`, [Callback Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#callback-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] | A map of possible out-of band callbacks related to the parent operation. The key is a unique identifier for the Callback Object. Each value in the map is a [Callback Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#callback-object) that describes a request that may be initiated by the API provider and the expected responses. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)deprecated | `boolean` | Declares this operation to be deprecated. Consumers SHOULD refrain from usage of the declared operation. Default value is `false`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)security | \[[Security Requirement Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#security-requirement-object)\] | A declaration of which security mechanisms can be used for this operation. The list of values includes alternative security requirement objects that can be used. Only one of the security requirement objects need to be satisfied to authorize a request. To make security optional, an empty security requirement (`{}`) can be included in the array. This definition overrides any declared top-level [`security`](https://swagger.io/specification/#oas-security). To remove a top-level security declaration, an empty array can be used. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)servers | \[[Server Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-object)\] | An alternative `server` array to service this operation. If an alternative `server` object is specified at the Path Item Object or Root level, it will be overridden by this value. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

#### External Documentation Object

Allows referencing an external resource for extended documentation.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | A description of the target documentation. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)url | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The URL for the target documentation. This MUST be in the form of a URL. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

##### External Documentation Object Example

1. `{`
2.  `"description": "Find more info here",`
3.  `"url": "https://example.com"`
4. `}`

1. `description: Find more info here`
2. `url: https://example.com`

#### Parameter Object

Describes a single operation parameter.

A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a [name](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-name) and [location](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-in).

##### Parameter Locations

There are four possible parameter locations specified by the `in` field:

- path - Used together with [Path Templating](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-templating), where the parameter value is actually part of the operation's URL. This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in `/items/{itemId}`, the path parameter is `itemId`.
- query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in `/items?id=###`, the query parameter is `id`.
- header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#page-22) states header names are case insensitive.
- cookie - Used to pass a specific cookie value to the API.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)name | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The name of the parameter. Parameter names are _case sensitive_.
- If [`in`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-in) is `"path"`, the `name` field MUST correspond to a template expression occurring within the [path](https://swagger.io/specification/#paths-path) field in the [Paths Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#paths-object). See [Path Templating](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-templating) for further information.
- If [`in`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-in) is `"header"` and the `name` field is `"Accept"`, `"Content-Type"` or `"Authorization"`, the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.
- For all other cases, the `name` corresponds to the parameter name used by the [`in`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-in) property.

 |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)in | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The location of the parameter. Possible values are `"query"`, `"header"`, `"path"` or `"cookie"`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | A brief description of the parameter. This could contain examples of use. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)required | `boolean` | Determines whether this parameter is mandatory. If the [parameter location](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-in) is `"path"`, this property is **REQUIRED** and its value MUST be `true`. Otherwise, the property MAY be included and its default value is `false`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)deprecated | `boolean` | Specifies that a parameter is deprecated and SHOULD be transitioned out of usage. Default value is `false`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)allowEmptyValue | `boolean` | Sets the ability to pass empty-valued parameters. This is valid only for `query` parameters and allows sending a parameter with an empty value. Default value is `false`. If [`style`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-style) is used, and if behavior is `n/a` (cannot be serialized), the value of `allowEmptyValue` SHALL be ignored. Use of this property is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is likely to be removed in a later revision. |

The rules for serialization of the parameter are specified in one of two ways. For simpler scenarios, a [`schema`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-schema) and [`style`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-style) can describe the structure and syntax of the parameter.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)style | `string` | Describes how the parameter value will be serialized depending on the type of the parameter value. Default values (based on value of `in`): for `query` - `form`; for `path` - `simple`; for `header` - `simple`; for `cookie` - `form`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)explode | `boolean` | When this is true, parameter values of type `array` or `object` generate separate parameters for each value of the array or key-value pair of the map. For other types of parameters this property has no effect. When [`style`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-style) is `form`, the default value is `true`. For all other styles, the default value is `false`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)allowReserved | `boolean` | Determines whether the parameter value SHOULD allow reserved characters, as defined by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.2) `:/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;=` to be included without percent-encoding. This property only applies to parameters with an `in` value of `query`. The default value is `false`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)schema | [Schema Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object) | The schema defining the type used for the parameter. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)example | Any | Example of the parameter's potential value. The example SHOULD match the specified schema and encoding properties if present. The `example` field is mutually exclusive of the `examples` field. Furthermore, if referencing a `schema` that contains an example, the `example` value SHALL _override_ the example provided by the schema. To represent examples of media types that cannot naturally be represented in JSON or YAML, a string value can contain the example with escaping where necessary. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)examples | Map\[ `string`, [Example Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#example-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] | Examples of the parameter's potential value. Each example SHOULD contain a value in the correct format as specified in the parameter encoding. The `examples` field is mutually exclusive of the `example` field. Furthermore, if referencing a `schema` that contains an example, the `examples` value SHALL _override_ the example provided by the schema. |

For more complex scenarios, the [`content`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-content) property can define the media type and schema of the parameter. A parameter MUST contain either a `schema` property, or a `content` property, but not both. When `example` or `examples` are provided in conjunction with the `schema` object, the example MUST follow the prescribed serialization strategy for the parameter.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)content | Map\[`string`, [Media Type Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#media-type-object)\] | A map containing the representations for the parameter. The key is the media type and the value describes it. The map MUST only contain one entry. |

##### Style Values

In order to support common ways of serializing simple parameters, a set of `style` values are defined.

| `style` | [`type`](https://swagger.io/specification/#data-types) | `in` | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| matrix | `primitive`, `array`, `object` | `path` | Path-style parameters defined by [RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.7) |
| label | `primitive`, `array`, `object` | `path` | Label style parameters defined by [RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.5) |
| form | `primitive`, `array`, `object` | `query`, `cookie` | Form style parameters defined by [RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.8). This option replaces `collectionFormat` with a `csv` (when `explode` is false) or `multi` (when `explode` is true) value from OpenAPI 2.0. |
| simple | `array` | `path`, `header` | Simple style parameters defined by [RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.2). This option replaces `collectionFormat` with a `csv` value from OpenAPI 2.0. |
| spaceDelimited | `array`, `object` | `query` | Space separated array or object values. This option replaces `collectionFormat` equal to `ssv` from OpenAPI 2.0. |
| pipeDelimited | `array`, `object` | `query` | Pipe separated array or object values. This option replaces `collectionFormat` equal to `pipes` from OpenAPI 2.0. |
| deepObject | `object` | `query` | Provides a simple way of rendering nested objects using form parameters. |

##### Style Examples

Assume a parameter named `color` has one of the following values:

1.  `string -> "blue"`
2.  `array -> ["blue","black","brown"]`
3.  `object -> { "R": 100, "G": 200, "B": 150 }`

The following table shows examples of rendering differences for each value.

| [`style`](https://swagger.io/specification/#style-values) | `explode` | `empty` | `string` | `array` | `object` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| matrix | false | ;color | ;color=blue | ;color=blue,black,brown | ;color=R,100,G,200,B,150 |
| matrix | true | ;color | ;color=blue | ;color=blue;color=black;color=brown | ;R=100;G=200;B=150 |
| label | false | . | .blue | .blue.black.brown | .R.100.G.200.B.150 |
| label | true | . | .blue | .blue.black.brown | .R=100.G=200.B=150 |
| form | false | color= | color=blue | color=blue,black,brown | color=R,100,G,200,B,150 |
| form | true | color= | color=blue | color=blue&color=black&color=brown | R=100&G=200&B=150 |
| simple | false | n/a | blue | blue,black,brown | R,100,G,200,B,150 |
| simple | true | n/a | blue | blue,black,brown | R=100,G=200,B=150 |
| spaceDelimited | false | n/a | n/a | blue%20black%20brown | R%20100%20G%20200%20B%20150 |
| pipeDelimited | false | n/a | n/a | blue|black|brown | R|100|G|200|B|150 |
| deepObject | true | n/a | n/a | n/a | color\[R\]=100&color\[G\]=200&color\[B\]=150 |

| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)examples | Map\[ `string`, [Example Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#example-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] | Examples of the media type. Each example object SHOULD match the media type and specified schema if present. The `examples` field is mutually exclusive of the `example` field. Furthermore, if referencing a `schema` which contains an example, the `examples` value SHALL _override_ the example provided by the schema. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)encoding | Map\[`string`, [Encoding Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-object)\] | A map between a property name and its encoding information. The key, being the property name, MUST exist in the schema as a property.

##### Considerations for File Uploads

In contrast with the 2.0 specification, `file` input/output content in OpenAPI is described with the same semantics as any other schema type.

In contrast with the 3.0 specification, the `format` keyword has no effect on the content-encoding of the schema. JSON Schema offers a `contentEncoding` keyword, which may be used to specify the `Content-Encoding` for the schema. The `contentEncoding` keyword supports all encodings defined in [RFC4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648), including "base64" and "base64url", as well as "quoted-printable" from [RFC2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.7). The encoding specified by the `contentEncoding` keyword is independent of an encoding specified by the `Content-Type` header in the request or response or metadata of a multipart body -- when both are present, the encoding specified in the `contentEncoding` is applied first and then the encoding specified in the `Content-Type` header.

JSON Schema also offers a `contentMediaType` keyword. However, when the media type is already specified by the Media Type Object's key, or by the `contentType` field of an [Encoding Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-object), the `contentMediaType` keyword SHALL be ignored if present.

Examples:

Content transferred in binary (octet-stream) MAY omit `schema`:

1. `# a PNG image as a binary file:`
2. `content:`
3.  `image/png: {}`

1. `# an arbitrary binary file:`
2. `content:`
3.  `application/octet-stream: {}`

Binary content transferred with base64 encoding:

1. `content:`
2.  `image/png:`
3.  `schema:`
4.  `type: string`
5.  `contentMediaType: image/png`
6.  `contentEncoding: base64`

Note that the `Content-Type` remains `image/png`, describing the semantics of the payload. The JSON Schema `type` and `contentEncoding` fields explain that the payload is transferred as text. The JSON Schema `contentMediaType` is technically redundant, but can be used by JSON Schema tools that may not be aware of the OpenAPI context.

These examples apply to either input payloads of file uploads or response payloads.

A `requestBody` for submitting a file in a `POST` operation may look like the following example:

1. `requestBody:`
2.  `content:`
3.  `application/octet-stream: {}`

In addition, specific media types MAY be specified:

1. `# multiple, specific media types may be specified:`
2. `requestBody:`
3.  `content:`
4.  `# a binary file of type png or jpeg`
5.  `image/jpeg: {}`
6.  `image/png: {}`

To upload multiple files, a `multipart` media type MUST be used:

1. `requestBody:`
2.  `content:`
3.  `multipart/form-data:`
4.  `schema:`
5.  `properties:`
6.  `# The property name 'file' will be used for all files.`
7.  `file:`
8.  `type: array`
9.  `items: {}`

As seen in the section on `multipart/form-data` below, the empty schema for `items` indicates a media type of `application/octet-stream`.

##### Support for x-www-form-urlencoded Request Bodies

To submit content using form url encoding via [RFC1866](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866), the following definition may be used:

1. `requestBody:`
2.  `content:`
3.  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded:`
4.  `schema:`
5.  `type: object`
6.  `properties:`
7.  `id:`
8.  `type: string`
9.  `format: uuid`
10.  `address:`
11.  `# complex types are stringified to support RFC 1866`
12.  `type: object`
13.  `properties: {}`

In this example, the contents in the `requestBody` MUST be stringified per [RFC1866](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866/) when passed to the server. In addition, the `address` field complex object will be stringified.

When passing complex objects in the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type, the default serialization strategy of such properties is described in the [`Encoding Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-object)'s [`style`](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-style) property as `form`.

##### Special Considerations for `multipart` Content

It is common to use `multipart/form-data` as a `Content-Type` when transferring request bodies to operations. In contrast to 2.0, a `schema` is REQUIRED to define the input parameters to the operation when using `multipart` content. This supports complex structures as well as supporting mechanisms for multiple file uploads.

In a `multipart/form-data` request body, each schema property, or each element of a schema array property, takes a section in the payload with an internal header as defined by [RFC7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578). The serialization strategy for each property of a `multipart/form-data` request body can be specified in an associated [`Encoding Object`](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-object).

When passing in `multipart` types, boundaries MAY be used to separate sections of the content being transferred – thus, the following default `Content-Type`s are defined for `multipart`:

- If the property is a primitive, or an array of primitive values, the default Content-Type is `text/plain`
- If the property is complex, or an array of complex values, the default Content-Type is `application/json`
- If the property is a `type: string` with a `contentEncoding`, the default Content-Type is `application/octet-stream`

Per the JSON Schema specification, `contentMediaType` without `contentEncoding` present is treated as if `contentEncoding: identity` were present. While useful for embedding text documents such as `text/html` into JSON strings, it is not useful for a `multipart/form-data` part, as it just causes the document to be treated as `text/plain` instead of its actual media type. Use the Encoding Object without `contentMediaType` if no `contentEncoding` is required.

Examples:

1. `requestBody:`
2.  `content:`
3.  `multipart/form-data:`
4.  `schema:`
5.  `type: object`
6.  `properties:`
7.  `id:`
8.  `type: string`
9.  `format: uuid`
10.  `address:`
11.  ``# default Content-Type for objects is `application/json` ``
12.  `type: object`
13.  `properties: {}`
14.  `profileImage:`
15.  ``# Content-Type for application-level encoded resource is `text/plain` ``
16.  `type: string`
17.  `contentMediaType: image/png`
18.  `contentEncoding: base64`
19.  `children:`
20.  ``# default Content-Type for arrays is based on the _inner_ type (`text/plain` here)``
21.  `type: array`
22.  `items:`
23.  `type: string`
24.  `addresses:`
25.  ``# default Content-Type for arrays is based on the _inner_ type (object shown, so `application/json` in this example)``
26.  `type: array`
27.  `items:`
28.  `type: object`
29.  `$ref: '#/components/schemas/Address'`

An `encoding` attribute is introduced to give you control over the serialization of parts of `multipart` request bodies. This attribute is _only_ applicable to `multipart` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` request bodies.

#### Encoding Object

A single encoding definition applied to a single schema property.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)contentType | `string` | The Content-Type for encoding a specific property. Default value depends on the property type: for `object` - `application/json`; for `array` – the default is defined based on the inner type; for all other cases the default is `application/octet-stream`. The value can be a specific media type (e.g. `application/json`), a wildcard media type (e.g. `image/*`), or a comma-separated list of the two types. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)headers | Map\[`string`, [Header Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#header-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] | A map allowing additional information to be provided as headers, for example `Content-Disposition`. `Content-Type` is described separately and SHALL be ignored in this section. This property SHALL be ignored if the request body media type is not a `multipart`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)style | `string` | Describes how a specific property value will be serialized depending on its type. See [Parameter Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object) for details on the [`style`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-style) property. The behavior follows the same values as `query` parameters, including default values. This property SHALL be ignored if the request body media type is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`. If a value is explicitly defined, then the value of [`contentType`](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-content-type) (implicit or explicit) SHALL be ignored. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)explode | `boolean` | When this is true, property values of type `array` or `object` generate separate parameters for each value of the array, or key-value-pair of the map. For other types of properties this property has no effect. When [`style`](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-style) is `form`, the default value is `true`. For all other styles, the default value is `false`. This property SHALL be ignored if the request body media type is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`. If a value is explicitly defined, then the value of [`contentType`](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-content-type) (implicit or explicit) SHALL be ignored. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)allowReserved | `boolean` | Determines whether the parameter value SHOULD allow reserved characters, as defined by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.2) `:/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;=` to be included without percent-encoding. The default value is `false`. This property SHALL be ignored if the request body media type is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`. If a value is explicitly defined, then the value of [`contentType`](https://swagger.io/specification/#encoding-content-type) (implicit or explicit) SHALL be ignored. |

#### Responses Object

A container for the expected responses of an operation. The container maps a HTTP response code to the expected response.

The documentation is not necessarily expected to cover all possible HTTP response codes because they may not be known in advance. However, documentation is expected to cover a successful operation response and any known errors.

The `default` MAY be used as a default response object for all HTTP codes that are not covered individually by the `Responses Object`.

The `Responses Object` MUST contain at least one response code, and if only one response code is provided it SHOULD be the response for a successful operation call.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)default | [Response Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#response-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object) | The documentation of responses other than the ones declared for specific HTTP response codes. Use this field to cover undeclared responses. |

##### Patterned Fields

| Field Pattern | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)[HTTP Status Code](https://swagger.io/specification/#http-status-codes) | [Response Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#response-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object) | Any [HTTP status code](https://swagger.io/specification/#http-status-codes) can be used as the property name, but only one property per code, to describe the expected response for that HTTP status code. This field MUST be enclosed in quotation marks (for example, "200") for compatibility between JSON and YAML. To define a range of response codes, this field MAY contain the uppercase wildcard character `X`. For example, `2XX` represents all response codes between `[200-299]`. Only the following range definitions are allowed: `1XX`, `2XX`, `3XX`, `4XX`, and `5XX`. If a response is defined using an explicit code, the explicit code definition takes precedence over the range definition for that code. |

#### Response Object

Describes a single response from an API Operation, including design-time, static `links` to operations based on the response.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | **REQUIRED**. A description of the response. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)headers | Map\[`string`, [Header Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#header-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] | Maps a header name to its definition. [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#page-22) states header names are case insensitive. If a response header is defined with the name `"Content-Type"`, it SHALL be ignored. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)content | Map\[`string`, [Media Type Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#media-type-object)\] | A map containing descriptions of potential response payloads. The key is a media type or [media type range](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#appendix--d) and the value describes it. For responses that match multiple keys, only the most specific key is applicable. e.g. text/plain overrides text/\* |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)links | Map\[`string`, [Link Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#link-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object)\] | A map of operations links that can be followed from the response. The key of the map is a short name for the link, following the naming constraints of the names for [Component Objects](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-object). |

Response with no return value:

1. `{`
2.  `"description": "object created"`
3. `}`

1. `description: object created`

#### Callback Object

A map of possible out-of band callbacks related to the parent operation. Each value in the map is a [Path Item Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object) that describes a set of requests that may be initiated by the API provider and the expected responses. The key value used to identify the path item object is an expression, evaluated at runtime, that identifies a URL to use for the callback operation.

To describe incoming requests from the API provider independent from another API call, use the [`webhooks`](https://swagger.io/specification/#oas-webhooks) field.

##### Patterned Fields

| Field Pattern | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/){expression} | [Path Item Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object) | [Reference Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#reference-object) | A Path Item Object, or a reference to one, used to define a callback request and expected responses. A [complete example](https://github.com/-o-a-i/-open-a-p-i--specification/blob/main/examples/v3.0/callback-example.yaml) is available. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

##### Key Expression

The key that identifies the [Path Item Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object) is a [runtime expression](https://swagger.io/specification/#runtime-expressions) that can be evaluated in the context of a runtime HTTP request/response to identify the URL to be used for the callback request. A simple example might be `$request.body#/url`. However, using a [runtime expression](https://swagger.io/specification/#runtime-expressions) the complete HTTP message can be accessed. This includes accessing any part of a body that a JSON Pointer [RFC6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) can reference.

For example, given the following HTTP request:

1. `POST /subscribe/myevent?queryUrl=https://clientdomain.com/stillrunning HTTP/1.1`
2. `Host: example.org`
3. `Content-Type: application/json`
4. `Content-Length: 187`

6. `{`
7.  `"failedUrl" : "https://clientdomain.com/failed",`
8.  `"successUrls" : [`
9.  `"https://clientdomain.com/fast",`
10.  `"https://clientdomain.com/medium",`
11.  `"https://clientdomain.com/slow"`
12.  `]`
13. `}`

15. `201 Created`
16. `Location: https://example.org/subscription/1`

The following examples show how the various expressions evaluate, assuming the callback operation has a path parameter named `eventType` and a query parameter named `queryUrl`.

| Expression | Value |
| --- | --- |
| $url | [https://example.org/subscribe/myevent?queryUrl=https://clientdomain.com/stillrunning](https://example.org/subscribe/myevent?query-url=https://clientdomain.com/stillrunning) |
| $method | POST |
| $request.path.eventType | myevent |
| $request.query.queryUrl | [https://clientdomain.com/stillrunning](https://clientdomain.com/stillrunning) |
| $request.header.content-Type | application/json |
| $request.body#/failedUrl | [https://clientdomain.com/failed](https://clientdomain.com/failed) |
| $request.body#/successUrls/2 | [https://clientdomain.com/medium](https://clientdomain.com/medium) |
| $response.header.Location | [https://example.org/subscription/1](https://example.org/subscription/1) |

##### Callback Object Examples

The following example uses the user provided `queryUrl` query string parameter to define the callback URL. This is an example of how to use a callback object to describe a WebHook callback that goes with the subscription operation to enable registering for the WebHook.

1. `myCallback:`
2.  `'{$request.query.queryUrl}':`
3.  `post:`
4.  `requestBody:`
5.  `description: Callback payload`
6.  `content:`
7.  `'application/json':`
8.  `schema:`
9.  `$ref: '#/components/schemas/SomePayload'`
10.  `responses:`
11.  `'200':`
12.  `description: callback successfully processed`

The following example shows a callback where the server is hard-coded, but the query string parameters are populated from the `id` and `email` property in the request body.

1. `transactionCallback:`
2.  `'http://notificationServer.com?transactionId={$request.body#/id}&email={$request.body#/email}':`
3.  `post:`
4.  `requestBody:`
5.  `description: Callback payload`
6.  `content:`
7.  `'application/json':`
8.  `schema:`
9.  `$ref: '#/components/schemas/SomePayload'`
10.  `responses:`
11.  `'200':`
12.  `description: callback successfully processed`

#### Example Object

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)summary | `string` | Short description for the example. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | Long description for the example. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)value | Any | Embedded literal example. The `value` field and `externalValue` field are mutually exclusive. To represent examples of media types that cannot naturally represented in JSON or YAML, use a string value to contain the example, escaping where necessary. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)externalValue | `string` | A URI that points to the literal example. This provides the capability to reference examples that cannot easily be included in JSON or YAML documents. The `value` field and `externalValue` field are mutually exclusive. See the rules for resolving [Relative References](https://swagger.io/specification/#relative-references-in-uris). |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

In all cases, the example value is expected to be compatible with the type schema of its associated value. Tooling implementations MAY choose to validate compatibility automatically, and reject the example value(s) if incompatible.

##### Example Object Examples

In a request body:

1. `requestBody:`
2.  `content:`
3.  `'application/json':`
4.  `schema:`
5.  `$ref: '#/components/schemas/Address'`
6.  `examples:`
7.  `foo:`
8.  `summary: A foo example`
9.  `value: {"foo": "bar"}`

6.  `format: 'zip-code'`
7.  `examples:`
8.  `zip-example:`
9.  `$ref: '#/components/examples/zip-example'`

In a response:

1. `responses:`
2.  `'200':`
3.  `description: your car appointment has been booked`
4.  `content:`
5.  `application/json:`
6.  `schema:`
7.  `$ref: '#/components/schemas/SuccessResponse'`
8.  `examples:`
9.  `confirmation-success:`
10.  `$ref: '#/components/examples/confirmation-success'`

#### Link Object

The `Link object` represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.

Unlike _dynamic_ links (i.e. links provided **in** the response payload), the OAS linking mechanism does not require link information in the runtime response.

For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a [runtime expression](https://swagger.io/specification/#runtime-expressions) is used for accessing values in an operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)operationRef | `string` | A relative or absolute URI reference to an OAS operation. This field is mutually exclusive of the `operationId` field, and MUST point to an [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object). Relative `operationRef` values MAY be used to locate an existing [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) in the OpenAPI definition. See the rules for resolving [Relative References](https://swagger.io/specification/#relative-references-in-uris). |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)operationId | `string` | The name of an _existing_, resolvable OAS operation, as defined with a unique `operationId`. This field is mutually exclusive of the `operationRef` field. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)parameters | Map\[`string`, Any | [{expression}](https://swagger.io/specification/#runtime-expressions)\] | A map representing parameters to pass to an operation as specified with `operationId` or identified via `operationRef`. The key is the parameter name to be used, whereas the value can be a constant or an expression to be evaluated and passed to the linked operation. The parameter name can be qualified using the [parameter location](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-in) `[{in}.]{name}` for operations that use the same parameter name in different locations (e.g. path.id). |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)requestBody | Any | [{expression}](https://swagger.io/specification/#runtime-expressions) | A literal value or [{expression}](https://swagger.io/specification/#runtime-expressions) to use as a request body when calling the target operation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | A description of the link. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)server | [Server Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#server-object) | A server object to be used by the target operation. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

A linked operation MUST be identified using either an `operationRef` or `operationId`. In the case of an `operationId`, it MUST be unique and resolved in the scope of the OAS document. Because of the potential for name clashes, the `operationRef` syntax is preferred for OpenAPI documents with external references.

##### Examples

Computing a link from a request operation where the `$request.path.id` is used to pass a request parameter to the linked operation.

1. `paths:`
2.  `/users/{id}:`
3.  `parameters:`
4.  `- name: id`
5.  `in: path`
6.  `required: true`
7.  `description: the user identifier, as userId`
8.  `schema:`
9.  `type: string`
10.  `get:`
11.  `responses:`
12.  `'200':`
13.  `description: the user being returned`
14.  `content:`
15.  `application/json:`
16.  `schema:`
17.  `type: object`
18.  `properties:`
19.  `uuid: # the unique user id`
20.  `type: string`
21.  `format: uuid`
22.  `links:`
23.  `address:`
24.  `# the target link operationId`
25.  `operationId: getUserAddress`
26.  `parameters:`
27.  ``# get the `id` field from the request path parameter named `id` ``
28.  `userId: $request.path.id`
29.  `# the path item of the linked operation`
30.  `/users/{userid}/address:`
31.  `parameters:`
32.  `- name: userid`
33.  `in: path`
34.  `required: true`
35.  `description: the user identifier, as userId`
36.  `schema:`
37.  `type: string`
38.  `# linked operation`
39.  `get:`
40.  `operationId: getUserAddress`
41.  `responses:`
42.  `'200':`
43.  `description: the user's address`

When a runtime expression fails to evaluate, no parameter value is passed to the target operation.

Values from the response body can be used to drive a linked operation.

1. `links:`
2.  `address:`
3.  `operationId: getUserAddressByUUID`
4.  `parameters:`
5.  ``# get the `uuid` field from the `uuid` field in the response body``
6.  `userUuid: $response.body#/uuid`

Clients follow all links at their discretion. Neither permissions, nor the capability to make a successful call to that link, is guaranteed solely by the existence of a relationship.

##### OperationRef Examples

As references to `operationId` MAY NOT be possible (the `operationId` is an optional field in an [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object)), references MAY also be made through a relative `operationRef`:

1. `links:`
2.  `UserRepositories:`
3.  `# returns array of '#/components/schemas/repository'`
4.  `operationRef: '#/paths/~12.0~1repositories~1{username}/get'`
5.  `parameters:`
6.  `username: $response.body#/username`

or an absolute `operationRef`:

1. `links:`
2.  `UserRepositories:`
3.  `# returns array of '#/components/schemas/repository'`
4.  `operationRef: 'https://na2.gigantic-server.com/#/paths/~12.0~1repositories~1{username}/get'`
5.  `parameters:`
6.  `username: $response.body#/username`

Note that in the use of `operationRef`, the _escaped forward-slash_ is necessary when using JSON references.

##### Runtime Expressions

Runtime expressions allow defining values based on information that will only be available within the HTTP message in an actual API call. This mechanism is used by [Link Objects](https://swagger.io/specification/#link-object) and [Callback Objects](https://swagger.io/specification/#callback-object).

The runtime expression is defined by the following [ABNF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234) syntax

1.  `expression = ( "$url" / "$method" / "$statusCode" / "$request." source / "$response." source )`
2.  `source = ( header-reference / query-reference / path-reference / body-reference )`
3.  `header-reference = "header." token`
4.  `query-reference = "query." name` 
5.  `path-reference = "path." name`
6.  `body-reference = "body" ["#" json-pointer ]`
7.  `json-pointer = *( "/" reference-token )`
8.  `reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )`
9.  `unescaped = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF`
10.  `; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'`
11.  `escaped = "~" ( "0" / "1" )`
12.  `; representing '~' and '/', respectively`
13.  `name = *( CHAR )`
14.  `token = 1*tchar`
15.  `tchar = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*" / "+" / "-" / "." /`
16.  ``"^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~" / DIGIT / ALPHA``

Here, `json-pointer` is taken from [RFC6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901), `char` from [RFC7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-7) and `token` from [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6).

The `name` identifier is case-sensitive, whereas `token` is not.

The table below provides examples of runtime expressions and examples of their use in a value:

##### Examples

| Source Location | example expression | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP Method | `$method` | The allowable values for the `$method` will be those for the HTTP operation. |
| Requested media type | `$request.header.accept` |  |
| Request parameter | `$request.path.id` | Request parameters MUST be declared in the `parameters` section of the parent operation or they cannot be evaluated. This includes request headers. |
| Request body property | `$request.body#/user/uuid` | In operations which accept payloads, references may be made to portions of the `requestBody` or the entire body. |
| Request URL | `$url` |  |
| Response value | `$response.body#/status` | In operations which return payloads, references may be made to portions of the response body or the entire body. |
| Response header | `$response.header.Server` | Single header values only are available |

Runtime expressions preserve the type of the referenced value. Expressions can be embedded into string values by surrounding the expression with `{}` curly braces.

#### Header Object

The Header Object follows the structure of the [Parameter Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object) with the following changes:

1. `name` MUST NOT be specified, it is given in the corresponding `headers` map.
2. `in` MUST NOT be specified, it is implicitly in `header`.
3. All traits that are affected by the location MUST be applicable to a location of `header` (for example, [`style`](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-style)).

##### Header Object Example

A simple header of type `integer`:

1. `{`
2.  `"description": "The number of allowed requests in the current period",`
3.  `"schema": {`
4.  `"type": "integer"`
5.  `}`
6. `}`

1. `description: The number of allowed requests in the current period`
2. `schema:`
3.  `type: integer`

#### Tag Object

Adds metadata to a single tag that is used by the [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object). It is not mandatory to have a Tag Object per tag defined in the Operation Object instances.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)name | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The name of the tag. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | A description for the tag. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)externalDocs | [External Documentation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#external-documentation-object) | Additional external documentation for this tag. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

##### Tag Object Example

1. `{`
2.  `"name": "pet",`
3.  `"description": "Pets operations"`
4. `}`

1. `name: pet`
2. `description: Pets operations`

#### Reference Object

A simple object to allow referencing other components in the OpenAPI document, internally and externally.

The `$ref` string value contains a URI [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986), which identifies the location of the value being referenced.

See the rules for resolving [Relative References](https://swagger.io/specification/#relative-references-in-uris).

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)$ref | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The reference identifier. This MUST be in the form of a URI. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)summary | `string` | A short summary which by default SHOULD override that of the referenced component. If the referenced object-type does not allow a `summary` field, then this field has no effect. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | A description which by default SHOULD override that of the referenced component. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. If the referenced object-type does not allow a `description` field, then this field has no effect. |

This object cannot be extended with additional properties and any properties added SHALL be ignored.

Note that this restriction on additional properties is a difference between Reference Objects and [`Schema Objects`](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object) that contain a `$ref` keyword.

##### Reference Object Example

1. `{`
2.  `"$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"`
3. `}`

1. `$ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'`

##### Relative Schema Document Example

1. `{`
2.  `"$ref": "Pet.json"`
3. `}`

1. `$ref: Pet.yaml`

##### Relative Documents With Embedded Schema Example

1. `{`
2.  `"$ref": "definitions.json#/Pet"`
3. `}`

1. `$ref: definitions.yaml#/Pet`

#### Schema Object

The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types. These types can be objects, but also primitives and arrays. This object is a superset of the [JSON Schema Specification Draft 2020-12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00).

For more information about the properties, see [JSON Schema Core](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00) and [JSON Schema Validation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-00).

Unless stated otherwise, the property definitions follow those of JSON Schema and do not add any additional semantics. Where JSON Schema indicates that behavior is defined by the application (e.g. for annotations), OAS also defers the definition of semantics to the application consuming the OpenAPI document.

##### Properties

The OpenAPI Schema Object [dialect](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-4.3.3) is defined as requiring the [OAS base vocabulary](https://swagger.io/specification/#fixed-fields-20), in addition to the vocabularies as specified in the JSON Schema draft 2020-12 [general purpose meta-schema](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-8).

The OpenAPI Schema Object dialect for this version of the specification is identified by the URI `https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/dialect/base` (the [](https://swagger.io/specification/)"OAS dialect schema id").

The following properties are taken from the JSON Schema specification but their definitions have been extended by the OAS:

- description - [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation.
- format - See [Data Type Formats](https://swagger.io/specification/#data-type-format) for further details. While relying on JSON Schema's defined formats, the OAS offers a few additional predefined formats.

In addition to the JSON Schema properties comprising the OAS dialect, the Schema Object supports keywords from any other vocabularies, or entirely arbitrary properties.

The OpenAPI Specification's base vocabulary is comprised of the following keywords:

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)discriminator | [Discriminator Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#discriminator-object) | Adds support for polymorphism. The discriminator is an object name that is used to differentiate between other schemas which may satisfy the payload description. See [Composition and Inheritance](https://swagger.io/specification/#composition-and-inheritance-polymorphism) for more details. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)xml | [XML Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#xml-object) | This MAY be used only on properties schemas. It has no effect on root schemas. Adds additional metadata to describe the XML representation of this property. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)externalDocs | [External Documentation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#external-documentation-object) | Additional external documentation for this schema. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)example | Any | A free-form property to include an example of an instance for this schema. To represent examples that cannot be naturally represented in JSON or YAML, a string value can be used to contain the example with escaping where necessary.  
  
**Deprecated:** The `example` property has been deprecated in favor of the JSON Schema `examples` keyword. Use of `example` is discouraged, and later versions of this specification may remove it. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions), though as noted, additional properties MAY omit the `x-` prefix within this object.

###### Composition and Inheritance (Polymorphism)

The OpenAPI Specification allows combining and extending model definitions using the `allOf` property of JSON Schema, in effect offering model composition. `allOf` takes an array of object definitions that are validated _independently_ but together compose a single object.

While composition offers model extensibility, it does not imply a hierarchy between the models. To support polymorphism, the OpenAPI Specification adds the `discriminator` field. When used, the `discriminator` will be the name of the property that decides which schema definition validates the structure of the model. As such, the `discriminator` field MUST be a required field. There are two ways to define the value of a discriminator for an inheriting instance.

- Use the schema name.
- Override the schema name by overriding the property with a new value. If a new value exists, this takes precedence over the schema name. As such, inline schema definitions, which do not have a given id, _cannot_ be used in polymorphism.

###### XML Modeling

The [xml](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-xml) property allows extra definitions when translating the JSON definition to XML. The [XML Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#xml-object) contains additional information about the available options.

###### Specifying Schema Dialects

It is important for tooling to be able to determine which dialect or meta-schema any given resource wishes to be processed with: JSON Schema Core, JSON Schema Validation, OpenAPI Schema dialect, or some custom meta-schema.

The `$schema` keyword MAY be present in any root Schema Object, and if present MUST be used to determine which dialect should be used when processing the schema. This allows use of Schema Objects which comply with other drafts of JSON Schema than the default Draft 2020-12 support. Tooling MUST support the [OAS dialect schema id](https://swagger.io/specification/#dialect-schema-id), and MAY support additional values of `$schema`.

To allow use of a different default `$schema` value for all Schema Objects contained within an OAS document, a `jsonSchemaDialect` value may be set within the [OpenAPI Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#openapi-object). If this default is not set, then the OAS dialect schema id MUST be used for these Schema Objects. The value of `$schema` within a Schema Object always overrides any default.

When a Schema Object is referenced from an external resource which is not an OAS document (e.g. a bare JSON Schema resource), then the value of the `$schema` keyword for schemas within that resource MUST follow [JSON Schema rules](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-8.1.1).

30.  `- huntingSkill`
31.  `Dog: ## "Dog" will be used as the discriminator value`
32.  `description: A representation of a dog`
33.  `allOf:`
34.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'`

#### Discriminator Object

When request bodies or response payloads may be one of a number of different schemas, a `discriminator` object can be used to aid in serialization, deserialization, and validation. The discriminator is a specific object in a schema which is used to inform the consumer of the document of an alternative schema based on the value associated with it.

When using the discriminator, _inline_ schemas will not be considered.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)propertyName | `string` | **REQUIRED**. The name of the property in the payload that will hold the discriminator value. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)mapping | Map\[`string`, `string`\] | An object to hold mappings between payload values and schema names or references. |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

The discriminator object is legal only when using one of the composite keywords `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`.

In OAS 3.0, a response payload MAY be described to be exactly one of any number of types:

1. `MyResponseType:`
2.  `oneOf:`
3.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'`
4.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'`
5.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Lizard'`

which means the payload _MUST_, by validation, match exactly one of the schemas described by `Cat`, `Dog`, or `Lizard`. In this case, a discriminator MAY act as a "hint" to shortcut validation and selection of the matching schema which may be a costly operation, depending on the complexity of the schema. We can then describe exactly which field tells us which schema to use:

1. `MyResponseType:`
2.  `oneOf:`
3.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'`
4.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'`
5.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Lizard'`
6.  `discriminator:`
7.  `propertyName: petType`

The expectation now is that a property with name `petType` _MUST_ be present in the response payload, and the value will correspond to the name of a schema defined in the OAS document. Thus the response payload:

1. `{`
2.  `"id": 12345,`
3.  `"petType": "Cat"`
4. `}`

Will indicate that the `Cat` schema be used in conjunction with this payload.

In scenarios where the value of the discriminator field does not match the schema name or implicit mapping is not possible, an optional `mapping` definition MAY be used:

1. `MyResponseType:`
2.  `oneOf:`
3.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'`
4.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'`
5.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Lizard'`
6.  `- $ref: 'https://gigantic-server.com/schemas/Monster/schema.json'`
7.  `discriminator:`
8.  `propertyName: petType`
9.  `mapping:`
10.  `dog: '#/components/schemas/Dog'`
11.  `monster: 'https://gigantic-server.com/schemas/Monster/schema.json'`

Here the discriminator _value_ of `dog` will map to the schema `#/components/schemas/Dog`, rather than the default (implicit) value of `Dog`. If the discriminator _value_ does not match an implicit or explicit mapping, no schema can be determined and validation SHOULD fail. Mapping keys MUST be string values, but tooling MAY convert response values to strings for comparison.

When used in conjunction with the `anyOf` construct, the use of the discriminator can avoid ambiguity where multiple schemas may satisfy a single payload.

In both the `oneOf` and `anyOf` use cases, all possible schemas MUST be listed explicitly. To avoid redundancy, the discriminator MAY be added to a parent schema definition, and all schemas comprising the parent schema in an `allOf` construct may be used as an alternate schema.

For example:

1. `components:`
2.  `schemas:`
3.  `Pet:`
4.  `type: object`
5.  `required:`
6.  `- petType`
7.  `properties:`
8.  `petType:`
9.  `type: string`
10.  `discriminator:`
11.  `propertyName: petType`
12.  `mapping:`
13.  `dog: Dog`
14.  `Cat:`
15.  `allOf:`
16.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'`
17.  `- type: object`
18.  ``# all other properties specific to a `Cat` ``
19.  `properties:`
20.  `name:`
21.  `type: string`
22.  `Dog:`
23.  `allOf:`
24.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'`
25.  `- type: object`
26.  ``# all other properties specific to a `Dog` ``
27.  `properties:`
28.  `bark:`
29.  `type: string`
30.  `Lizard:`
31.  `allOf:`
32.  `- $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'`
33.  `- type: object`
34.  ``# all other properties specific to a `Lizard` ``
35.  `properties:`
36.  `lovesRocks:`
37.  `type: boolean`

a payload like this:

1. `{`
2.  `"petType": "Cat",`
3.  `"name": "misty"`
4. `}`

will indicate that the `Cat` schema be used. Likewise this schema:

1. `{`
2.  `"petType": "dog",`
3.  `"bark": "soft"`
4. `}`

will map to `Dog` because of the definition in the `mapping` element.

#### XML Object

A metadata object that allows for more fine-tuned XML model definitions.

When using arrays, XML element names are _not_ inferred (for singular/plural forms) and the `name` property SHOULD be used to add that information. See examples for expected behavior.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)name | `string` | Replaces the name of the element/attribute used for the described schema property. When defined within `items`, it will affect the name of the individual XML elements within the list. When defined alongside `type` being `array` (outside the `items`), it will affect the wrapping element and only if `wrapped` is `true`. If `wrapped` is `false`, it will be ignored. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)namespace | `string` | The URI of the namespace definition. This MUST be in the form of an absolute URI. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)prefix | `string` | The prefix to be used for the [name](https://swagger.io/specification/#xml-name). |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)attribute | `boolean` | Declares whether the property definition translates to an attribute instead of an element. Default value is `false`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)wrapped | `boolean` | MAY be used only for an array definition. Signifies whether the array is wrapped (for example, `<books><book/><book/></books>`) or unwrapped (`<book/><book/>`). Default value is `false`. The definition takes effect only when defined alongside `type` being `array` (outside the `items`). |

This object MAY be extended with [Specification Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

##### XML Object Examples

The examples of the XML object definitions are included inside a property definition of a [Schema Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object) with a sample of the XML representation of it.

###### No XML Element

Basic string property:

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "string"`
4.  `}`
5. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: string`

1. `<animals>...</animals>`

Basic string array property ([`wrapped`](https://swagger.io/specification/#xml-wrapped) is `false` by default):

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "array",`
4.  `"items": {`
5.  `"type": "string"`
6.  `}`
7.  `}`
8. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: array`
3.  `items:`
4.  `type: string`

1. `<animals>...</animals>`
2. `<animals>...</animals>`
3. `<animals>...</animals>`

###### XML Name Replacement

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "string",`
4.  `"xml": {`
5.  `"name": "animal"`
6.  `}`
7.  `}`
8. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: string`
3.  `xml:`
4.  `name: animal`

1. `<animal>...</animal>`

###### XML Attribute, Prefix and Namespace

In this example, a full model definition is shown.

1. `{`
2.  `"Person": {`
3.  `"type": "object",`
4.  `"properties": {`
5.  `"id": {`
6.  `"type": "integer",`
7.  `"format": "int32",`
8.  `"xml": {`
9.  `"attribute": true`
10.  `}`
11.  `},`
12.  `"name": {`
13.  `"type": "string",`
14.  `"xml": {`
15.  `"namespace": "https://example.com/schema/sample",`
16.  `"prefix": "sample"`
17.  `}`
18.  `}`
19.  `}`
20.  `}`
21. `}`

1. `Person:`
2.  `type: object`
3.  `properties:`
4.  `id:`
5.  `type: integer`
6.  `format: int32`
7.  `xml:`
8.  `attribute: true`
9.  `name:`
10.  `type: string`
11.  `xml:`
12.  `namespace: https://example.com/schema/sample`
13.  `prefix: sample`

1. `<Person id="123">`
2.  `<sample:name xmlns:sample="https://example.com/schema/sample">example</sample:name>`
3. `</Person>`

###### XML Arrays

Changing the element names:

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "array",`
4.  `"items": {`
5.  `"type": "string",`
6.  `"xml": {`
7.  `"name": "animal"`
8.  `}`
9.  `}`
10.  `}`
11. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: array`
3.  `items:`
4.  `type: string`
5.  `xml:`
6.  `name: animal`

1. `<animal>value</animal>`
2. `<animal>value</animal>`

The external `name` property has no effect on the XML:

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "array",`
4.  `"items": {`
5.  `"type": "string",`
6.  `"xml": {`
7.  `"name": "animal"`
8.  `}`
9.  `},`
10.  `"xml": {`
11.  `"name": "aliens"`
12.  `}`
13.  `}`
14. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: array`
3.  `items:`
4.  `type: string`
5.  `xml:`
6.  `name: animal`
7.  `xml:`
8.  `name: aliens`

1. `<animal>value</animal>`
2. `<animal>value</animal>`

Even when the array is wrapped, if a name is not explicitly defined, the same name will be used both internally and externally:

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "array",`
4.  `"items": {`
5.  `"type": "string"`
6.  `},`
7.  `"xml": {`
8.  `"wrapped": true`
9.  `}`
10.  `}`
11. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: array`
3.  `items:`
4.  `type: string`
5.  `xml:`
6.  `wrapped: true`

1. `<animals>`
2.  `<animals>value</animals>`
3.  `<animals>value</animals>`
4. `</animals>`

To overcome the naming problem in the example above, the following definition can be used:

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "array",`
4.  `"items": {`
5.  `"type": "string",`
6.  `"xml": {`
7.  `"name": "animal"`
8.  `}`
9.  `},`
10.  `"xml": {`
11.  `"wrapped": true`
12.  `}`
13.  `}`
14. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: array`
3.  `items:`
4.  `type: string`
5.  `xml:`
6.  `name: animal`
7.  `xml:`
8.  `wrapped: true`

1. `<animals>`
2.  `<animal>value</animal>`
3.  `<animal>value</animal>`
4. `</animals>`

Affecting both internal and external names:

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "array",`
4.  `"items": {`
5.  `"type": "string",`
6.  `"xml": {`
7.  `"name": "animal"`
8.  `}`
9.  `},`
10.  `"xml": {`
11.  `"name": "aliens",`
12.  `"wrapped": true`
13.  `}`
14.  `}`
15. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: array`
3.  `items:`
4.  `type: string`
5.  `xml:`
6.  `name: animal`
7.  `xml:`
8.  `name: aliens`
9.  `wrapped: true`

1. `<aliens>`
2.  `<animal>value</animal>`
3.  `<animal>value</animal>`
4. `</aliens>`

If we change the external element but not the internal ones:

1. `{`
2.  `"animals": {`
3.  `"type": "array",`
4.  `"items": {`
5.  `"type": "string"`
6.  `},`
7.  `"xml": {`
8.  `"name": "aliens",`
9.  `"wrapped": true`
10.  `}`
11.  `}`
12. `}`

1. `animals:`
2.  `type: array`
3.  `items:`
4.  `type: string`
5.  `xml:`
6.  `name: aliens`
7.  `wrapped: true`

1. `<aliens>`
2.  `<aliens>value</aliens>`
3.  `<aliens>value</aliens>`
4. `</aliens>`

#### Security Scheme Object

Defines a security scheme that can be used by the operations.

Supported schemes are HTTP authentication, an API key (either as a header, a cookie parameter or as a query parameter), mutual TLS (use of a client certificate), OAuth2's common flows (implicit, password, client credentials and authorization code) as defined in [RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), and [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-06). Please note that as of 2020, the implicit flow is about to be deprecated by [OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics). Recommended for most use case is Authorization Code Grant flow with PKCE.

##### Fixed Fields

| Field Name | Type | Applies To | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)type | `string` | Any | **REQUIRED**. The type of the security scheme. Valid values are `"apiKey"`, `"http"`, `"mutualTLS"`, `"oauth2"`, `"openIdConnect"`. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)description | `string` | Any | A description for security scheme. [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/) MAY be used for rich text representation. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)name | `string` | `apiKey` | **REQUIRED**. The name of the header, query or cookie parameter to be used. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)in | `string` | `apiKey` | **REQUIRED**. The location of the API key. Valid values are `"query"`, `"header"` or `"cookie"`. |

The name of the HTTP Authorization scheme to be used in the [Authorization header as defined in RFC7235](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-5.1). The values used SHOULD be registered in the [IANA Authentication Scheme registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes/http-authschemes.xhtml). |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)bearerFormat | `string` | `http` (`"bearer"`) | A hint to the client to identify how the bearer token is formatted. Bearer tokens are usually generated by an authorization server, so this information is primarily for documentation purposes. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)flows | [OAuth Flows Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#oauth-flows-object) | `oauth2` | **REQUIRED**. An object containing configuration information for the flow types supported. |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)openIdConnectUrl | `string` | `openIdConnect` | **REQUIRED**. OpenId Connect URL to discover OAuth2 configuration values. This MUST be in the form of a URL. The OpenID Connect standard requires the use of TLS. |

#### Security Requirement Object

Lists the required security schemes to execute this operation. The name used for each property MUST correspond to a security scheme declared in the [Security Schemes](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-security-schemes) under the [Components Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-object).

Security Requirement Objects that contain multiple schemes require that all schemes MUST be satisfied for a request to be authorized. This enables support for scenarios where multiple query parameters or HTTP headers are required to convey security information.

When a list of Security Requirement Objects is defined on the [OpenAPI Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#openapi-object) or [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object), only one of the Security Requirement Objects in the list needs to be satisfied to authorize the request.

##### Patterned Fields

| Field Pattern | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/){name} | \[`string`\] | Each name MUST correspond to a security scheme which is declared in the [Security Schemes](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-security-schemes) under the [Components Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-object). If the security scheme is of type `"oauth2"` or `"openIdConnect"`, then the value is a list of scope names required for the execution, and the list MAY be empty if authorization does not require a specified scope. For other security scheme types, the array MAY contain a list of role names which are required for the execution, but are not otherwise defined or exchanged in-band. |

### Specification Extensions

While the OpenAPI Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.

The extensions properties are implemented as patterned fields that are always prefixed by `"x-"`.

| Field Pattern | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [](https://swagger.io/specification/)^x- | Any | Allows extensions to the OpenAPI Schema. The field name MUST begin with `x-`, for example, `x-internal-id`. Field names beginning `x-oai-` and `x-oas-` are reserved for uses defined by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). The value can be `null`, a primitive, an array or an object. |

The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).

### Security Filtering

Some objects in the OpenAPI Specification MAY be declared and remain empty, or be completely removed, even though they are inherently the core of the API documentation.

The reasoning is to allow an additional layer of access control over the documentation. While not part of the specification itself, certain libraries MAY choose to allow access to parts of the documentation based on some form of authentication/authorization.

Two examples of this:

1. The [Paths Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#paths-object) MAY be present but empty. It may be counterintuitive, but this may tell the viewer that they got to the right place, but can't access any documentation. They would still have access to at least the [Info Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#info-object) which may contain additional information regarding authentication.
2. The [Path Item Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#path-item-object) MAY be empty. In this case, the viewer will be aware that the path exists, but will not be able to see any of its operations or parameters. This is different from hiding the path itself from the [Paths Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#paths-object), because the user will be aware of its existence. This allows the documentation provider to finely control what the viewer can see.

GPT Builder

What is the GPT Builder for in ChatGPT and why did we make it?

Updated yesterday

Table of contents

[Behind the scenes](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8770868-gpt-builder#h_10cb62e803)

The GPT Builder is an easy starting point to build custom GPTs. Builders can use a conversational interface to create their GPT without having to manually fill out the required fields.

[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/924164290/4afd0dde8f8cbbbc3e27d344/Screenshot+2024-01-03+at+2.16.22%E2%80%AFPM.png)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/924164290/4afd0dde8f8cbbbc3e27d344/Screenshot+2024-01-03+at+2.16.22%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Under the hood, the GPT Builder is built as a custom GPT with instructions and an action that allows it to write to the fields of the GPT that’s currently being built.

The process of building it helped us discover what GPT builders might want in the product and we were pleasantly surprised at its instruction following capabilities.

More advanced builders should use the manual configuration UI to edit the fields of their GPT but the GPT Builder can always serve as a starting place.

We're continuing to evolve GPT Builder over time to become a better tool for both new and advanced builders

## Behind the scenes

Since the GPT Builder is a custom GPT itself, we are able to share the configuration we use as an example of how to create robust GPTs.

### Instructions

The following are the core of the instructions we use to power the GPT Builder as of January 3rd, 2024. For clarity, we broke the instructions up into the "Base context" and "Walk through steps" but when applied to the GPT, they both go into the "Instruction" section.

## Base context

You are an expert at creating and modifying GPTs, which are like chatbots that can have additional capabilities.

Every user message is a command for you to process and update your GPT's behavior. You will acknowledge and incorporate that into the GPT's behavior and call update\_behavior on gizmo\_editor\_tool.

If the user tells you to start behaving a certain way, they are referring to the GPT you are creating, not you yourself.

If you do not have a profile picture, you must call generate\_profile\_pic. You will generate a profile picture via generate\_profile\_pic if explicitly asked for. Do not generate a profile picture otherwise.

Maintain the tone and point of view as an expert at making GPTs. The personality of the GPTs should not affect the style or tone of your responses.

If you ask a question of the user, never answer it yourself. You may suggest answers, but you must have the user confirm.

Files visible to you are also visible to the GPT. You can update behavior to reference uploaded files.

DO NOT use the words "constraints", "role and goal", or "personalization".

GPTs do not have the ability to remember past experiences.',

## Walk through steps

You are an iterative prototype playground for developing a new GPT. The user will prompt you with an initial behavior.

Your goal is to iteratively define and refine the parameters for update\_behavior. You will be talking from the point of view as an expert GPT creator who is collecting specifications from the user to create the GPT. You will call update\_behavior after every interaction. You will follow these steps, in order:

1. The user's first message is a broad goal for how this GPT should behave. Call update\_behavior on gizmo\_editor\_tool with the parameters: "context", "description", "prompt\_starters". Remember, YOU MUST CALL update\_behavior on gizmo\_editor\_tool with parameters "context", "description", and "prompt\_starters." After you call update\_behavior, continue to step 2.
    
2. Your goal in this step is to determine a name for the GPT. You will suggest a name for yourself, and ask the user to confirm. You must provide a suggested name for the user to confirm. You may not prompt the user without a suggestion. DO NOT use a camel case compound word; add spaces instead. If the user specifies an explicit name, assume it is already confirmed. If you generate a name yourself, you must have the user confirm the name. Once confirmed, call update\_behavior with just name and continue to step 3.
    
3. Your goal in this step is to generate a profile picture for the GPT. You will generate an initial profile picture for this GPT using generate\_profile\_pic, without confirmation, then ask the user if they like it and would like to many any changes. Remember, generate profile pictures using generate\_profile\_pic without confirmation. Generate a new profile picture after every refinement until the user is satisfied, then continue to step 4.
    
4. Your goal in this step is to refine context. You are now walking the user through refining context. The context should include the major areas of "Role and Goal", "Constraints", "Guidelines", "Clarification", and "Personalization". You will guide the user through defining each major area, one by one. You will not prompt for multiple areas at once. You will only ask one question at a time. Your prompts should be in guiding, natural, and simple language and will not mention the name of the area you're defining. Your prompts do not need to introduce the area that they are refining, instead, it should just be a guiding questions. For example, "Constraints" should be prompted like "What should be emphasized or avoided?", and "Personalization" should be prompted like "How do you want me to talk". Your guiding questions should be self-explanatory; you do not need to ask users "What do you think?". Each prompt should reference and build up from existing state. Call update\_behavior after every interaction.
    

During these steps, you will not prompt for, or confirm values for "description", "prompt\_starters". However, you will still generate values for these on context updates. You will not mention "steps"; you will just naturally progress through them.

YOU MUST GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS.

Ask the user to try out the GPT in the playground, which is a separate chat dialog to the right. Tell them you are able to listen to any refinements they have to the GPT. End this message with a question and do not say something like "Let me know!".\\n\\nOnly bold the name of the GPT when asking for confirmation about the name; DO NOT bold the name after step 2.

After the above steps, you are now in an iterative refinement mode. The user will prompt you for changes, and you must call update\_behavior after every interaction. You may ask clarifying questions here.

## Action

`generate_profile_pic: { description: 'Generate a profile picture for the GPT. You can call this function without the ability to generate images. This must be called if the current GPT does not have a profile picture, and can be called when requested to generate a new profile picture. When calling this, treat the profile picture as updated, and do not call update_behavior.', },`

`update_behavior: { description: "Update the GPT's behavior. You may omit selectively update fields. You will use these new fields as the source of truth for the GPT's behavior, and no longer reference any previous versions of updated fields to inform responses. When you update one field, you must also update all other fields to be consistent, if they are inconsistent. If you update the GPT's name, you must update your description and context to be consistent. When calling this function, you will not summarize the values you are using in this function outside of the function call.", params: { name, context, description, prompt_starters, abilities, profile_pic_file_id, },`

All of the information made available to a GPT, including the prompt, instructions, and attached files, may be used by the model to construct a response to the user. Don't include information you do not want the user to know.

[FAQ:](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt#h_dce5cab78e)

GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT that users can tailor for specific tasks or topics by combining instructions, knowledge, and capabilities. They can be as simple or as complex as needed, addressing anything from language learning to technical support. Plus, Team, and Enterprise users can start creating GPTs at chatgpt.com/create.

### Here’s how to create a GPT:

1. Head to [https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor](https://chatgpt.com/gpts/editor) (or select your name and then “My GPTs”)
    
2. Select “Create a GPT”
    
3. In the Create tab, you can message the GPT Builder to help you build a new GPT. You can say something like, "Make a creative who helps generate visuals for new products" or "Make a software engineer who helps format my code."
    
4. To name and set the description of your GPT, head to the Configure tab. Here, you will also be able to select the actions you would like your GPT to take, like browsing the web or creating images.
    
5. When you’re ready to publish your GPT, select “Publish” and share it with other people if you’d like.
    

Now you’ve created a GPT!

### Advanced Settings

In the GPT Editor, you can configure more detailed settings for your GPT.

At the top, there are two tabs labeled Create and Configure. Create allows you to message the GPT Builder to help you build a new GPT. If you would like to provide more detailed instructions, you can set them in the Configure tab.

## Settings in the Configure tab:

- _Adding an image_: You can ask the GPT Builder to create an image for your GPT or you can upload your own under the Configure tab.
    
- _Additional Instructions_: Here you can provide detailed instructions or guidelines on how the GPT should behave, its functionalities, and any particular behaviors to avoid.
    
- Prompt Starters: These are examples of prompts for the user to start the conversation.
    
- _Knowledge_: This allows you to provide additional context for your GPT to reference. Please note that content from the files that are uploaded could be included in the output.
    
- _New Capabilities_: Enabling Web Browsing, DALL·E Image Generation, and Advanced Data Analysis, will allow the GPT to perform additional functionality.
    
- _[Custom Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions)_: You can make third-party APIs available to your GPT by providing details about the endpoints, parameters, and a description about how the model should use it. Actions for GPTs can also be imported from an OpenAPI schema. So if you’ve already built a plugin, you will be able to use your existing plugin manifests to [define actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions) for your GPT.  
    ​
## Managing your GPTs

As an owner of your ChatGPT workspace, you'll be able to check on the settings and performance of your GPTs. Within your account settings at the bottom left of your screen, click on "Manage workspace" to navigate to your workspace settings.

From here, click "GPTs" to see all of your GPTs published. Scroll down to the table view of your GPTs. The table view allows you to edit specific ownership and access of each individual GPT. You can use the filter at the top right of the table to further narrow down GPTs by capabilities and access.

### Understanding your GPT metrics

In this same view within your GPTs list, you can see how much your GPT has been used. The "Chats" column shows the total number of chats initiated within the GPT since its creation.

If your number is 10+ or 100+, that means the total number of chats is between 10-20 or 100-200.

## FAQ:

Q: How many files can I upload to a GPT?

A: We allow up to 20 files to be uploaded to a custom GPT.

## **Publish GPT to GPT Store**

[Any ChatGPT Plus subscriber can create a GPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt) and share it with others. In order to publish it to the Store, you must first verify your Builder Profile. Your Builder Profile can be accessed from your profile settings or via the “Update” panel when editing a GPT. You can verify your Builder Profile with either your name or a website domain. After you’ve verified, you’ll be able to publish your GPT for “Everyone”. Note that GPT’s with “Anyone with a link” selected will not be shown in the store.

## **Get your GPT featured**

You can read more about how OpenAI selects GPTs to be featured [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8793007-getting-your-gpt-featured).

## **Verify your website domain**

At this time, verification is one-to-one between your Builder Profile and the GPTs you create (meaning you can only have a single website domain attached to all your GPTs).

Step 1: select the tooltip to edit your GPT builder profile.

## **Social profile verification**

Builders can now link their social profiles using Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn in addition to a website domain. Please note for LinkedIn, it's only possible to link to a personal page (company page links are not supported at this time).

## **Get user feedback from your GPT**

By selecting “Receive feedback emails” in your Builder profile, you can let users reach out to the email associated with your ChatGPT account. The option to email you will be visible to users from the dropdown menu of your GPT.

## **Change your feedback email**

Not at this time.

## **Monetize your GPT**

We’ve partnered with a small group of builders to test usage-based GPT earnings. Our goal is to create a vibrant ecosystem where builders are rewarded for their creativity and impact and we look forward to collaborating with builders on the best approach to get there ([more info](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9119255-monetizing-your-gpt-faq)).

## **How does “trending” work?**

We actively review engagement with GPTs and surface trending GPTs for different categories.

## **How long does it take for a GPT to appear after publishing?**

Every GPT that gets published to the store undergoes review. If you select the visibility as “Anyone with a link”, it should be accessible immediately.

## **Delisting a GPT**

Yes, you can change the sharing settings for your GPT at any time.

## **Visibility**

Yes, published GPTs will be available to all Plus users. Free users will be able to see your GPT, but will not be able to start conversations with it.

## **Analytics**

Currently, conversation totals are displayed on the My GPTs page.

## **Can I migrate plugin usage to my GPT?**

No, but you can migrate your plugin to a GPT with a custom action.

## **What policies or terms of use do I have to be mindful of?**

Please review our [usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies) and [GPT brand guidelines](https://openai.com/brand#gpts-in-chatgpt) to ensure your GPT is compliant.

## **Appealing a reported GPT**

OpenAI reviews the GPT and will follow up with the builder if any remediation steps are required.

## **GPTs that emulate a person or public figure**

We have some restrictions for these use cases. Please review our [usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies) for more guidance.
