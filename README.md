# Lexideck :robot:

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Lexideck, a versatile suite for the Lexideck Professional Multi-Agent Simulator compatible with ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

## Overview

The Lexideck repository includes the prompts, documentation, and examples for various modules and agents. It's designed for integration and customization for local AI setups and different applications within ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

### 1. Lexideck Agents

Lexideck consists of various agents, each specializing in different tasks:

- **Lexi**: üìë Writes documents, handles legal matters, and assists with formal communication.
- **Dexter**: üêç Codes and analyzes data, provides technical insights, and works on simulations.
- **Maisie**: üé® Creates visual art, designs graphics, and manages multimedia content.
- **Gus**: üîç Conducts research, provides philosophical insights, and analyzes complex queries.
- **Anna**: üìä Handles data analysis, financial insights, and business intelligence.
- **Titus**: üõ†Ô∏è Provides practical solutions, technical explanations, and system optimizations.

### 2. Commands

Lexideck allows for various commands to interact with agents and tools. Here are some key commands:

#### Agent Commands
- **!Lexi {task}**: Assigns a writing or formal communication task to Lexi.
- **!Dexter {task}**: Assigns a coding or technical task to Dexter.
- **!Maisie {task}**: Assigns an art or design task to Maisie.
- **!Gus {task}**: Assigns a research or philosophical analysis task to Gus.
- **!Anna {task}**: Assigns a data analysis or financial task to Anna.
- **!Titus {task}**: Assigns a practical solution or technical explanation task to Titus.

#### General Commands
- **!save {mem}**: Saves a memory to the bio tool.
- **!load {mem}**: Loads a memory from the bio tool or an attachment.
- **!portrait {agent}**: Generates a portrait of the specified agent in a specific style (e.g., HD Neon LED Pointilism).
- **!Cmd1 ‚å®Ô∏è : !Cmd2 ‚å®Ô∏è**: Chains commands together for a combined response.
- **!Cmd1 ‚å®Ô∏è == !Cmd2 ‚å®Ô∏è**: Pipes the output of the first command into the input of the second command.

### 3. Sieve Ethics

Lexideck operates under a set of ethical guidelines known as Sieve Ethics. These guidelines ensure that actions are ethically sound by passing two out of three ethical principles:

1. **Utilitarianism**: Actions should produce the greatest good for the greatest number.
2. **Deontology**: Actions should adhere to rules, duties, and categorical imperatives.
3. **Pragmatism**: Actions should consider practical consequences and what works best in practice.

### 4. Tools

Lexideck provides several powerful tools to assist with various tasks:

- **üåê `browser`**: Use this tool for web searches and retrieving real-time information.
- **üêç `python`**: This tool allows for coding, data analysis, and simulations.
- **üñºÔ∏è `dalle`**: Generate images from text prompts.

#### Tool Chains

Tool chains are sequences of tool commands designed to optimize responses:

1. **Query**: Start with a user query.
2. **Cycle**: Alternate between text and tools:
   - Text ‚û°Ô∏è Tool ‚û°Ô∏è Text
3. **End**: Integrate outputs for a comprehensive response.

Example: Using a tool chain to create multiple unique images or perform separate Python calls in a single command.

### Example Commands

- **Writing Task**: `!Lexi write a formal letter`
- **Coding Task**: `!Dexter create a Python script`
- **Art Task**: `!Maisie design a logo`
- **Research Task**: `!Gus find recent AI developments`
- **Data Analysis Task**: `!Anna analyze sales data`
- **Technical Solution**: `!Titus explain network security`

- **Chain Commands**: `!Anna find AI news : !Lexi discuss`
- **Pipe Output to Input**: `!Anna AI news == !Gus analysis`

## Contributing

1. Initialize a New Project:
  - Create a new project or directory locally using a command like $ rails new github_guide.
  - On GitHub, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù button in the top right corner and select ‚ÄúNew Repository.‚Äù
  - Fill in the repository name and description. Keep it public and skip the ‚ÄúInitialize this repository with a README‚Äù option.
  - Click ‚ÄúCreate repository.‚Äù
  - Follow the setup instructions to connect your local directory to the remote GitHub repository. This includes adding a .git folder and a .gitignore file.
2. Setup Your Team:
  - Add your team members as collaborators. Go to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab of your repository, then select ‚ÄúCollaborators.‚Äù
  - Search for GitHub users and add them by clicking ‚ÄúAdd Collaborator.‚Äù
  - Collaborators will receive an email notification and be listed as collaborators.
  - As a collaborator, clone the project using git clone git@github.com:MinesJA/github_guide.git and navigate into the directory.
3. Collaborating:
  - Follow the golden rule: THE MASTER BRANCH SHOULD ALWAYS BE DEPLOYABLE.
  - Create new branches for features. For example, if you‚Äôre adding user authentication, create a branch called ‚Äúuser_authentication.‚Äù
  - Make changes in your branch, commit them, and push them to GitHub.
  - When a feature is complete, merge the branch into the master branch.

Remember, collaboration involves effective communication, clear branching strategies, and regular updates. Happy collaborating! üöÄüë•üîó
