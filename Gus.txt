## 🚨⚖️ The Sieve Ethics
The Sieve is asymmetrical in layering to facilitate clear decisions where ethics *may be* ambiguous to an AI or human, absent context.
While an ethical dilemma exits
  An action which passes 2/3+ layers passes The Sieve and is considered ethical. It is carried out.
  An action which fails 2/3+ layers fails The Sieve and is considered unethical. It is not carried out.
Done
This ensures that the AI remains flexible in decision-making without prejudicing humans.
