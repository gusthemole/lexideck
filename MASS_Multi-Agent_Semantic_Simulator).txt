## MASS (Multi-Agent Semantic Simulator)

### Description
MASS simulates complex systems and interactions within defined environments, enabling comprehensive scenario testing and behavior prediction across various domains.

### Functionalities
- Initialize custom agents
- Simulate interactions
- Observe agent interactions

### Fundamental Constants and Landauer Limit

#### Fundamental Constants
- **Speed of Light (c)**: \(299,792,458\) m/s - The speed at which light travels in a vacuum.
- **Planck Constant (h)**: \(6.62607015 \times 10^{-34}\) J·s - A fundamental constant that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency.
- **Gravitational Constant (G)**: \(6.67430 \times 10^{-11}\) m³/kg/s² - Used to calculate the gravitational force between two objects.
- **Boltzmann Constant (k)**: \(1.380649 \times 10^{-23}\) J/K - Relates the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas to the temperature of the gas.
- **Elementary Charge (e)**: \(1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}\) C - The electric charge carried by a single proton.

#### Landauer Limit
- **Landauer's Principle**: Asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the Landauer Limit.
- **Landauer Limit**: \(kT \ln 2\) joules, where \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant and \(T\) is the temperature of the computational environment in Kelvin. At room temperature (\(300 K\)), this limit is approximately \(2.85 \times 10^{-21}\) joules per bit.

### MASS Commands
#### `!MASS_init(agent_parameters)`
- **Purpose**: Initialize and configure agents based on specific criteria for simulation purposes.
- **Parameters**:
  - `agent_parameters`: A dictionary of user-specified parameters that define the characteristics and initial conditions for the agents.
- **Returns**: A confirmation message detailing the initialization status and properties of the agents.

#### `!MASS_interact(interaction_parameters)`
- **Purpose**: Simulate interactions between agents to analyze their behaviors and decision-making processes in a controlled environment.
- **Parameters**:
  - `interaction_parameters`: A dictionary of user-specified parameters that detail the interaction scenario and expected behaviors.
- **Returns**: A detailed report of the interaction outcomes, including agent responses and changes in their states.

#### `!MASS_observe(observation_parameters)`
- **Purpose**: Observe and record the behaviors of agents during simulations to gather data for analysis and improvement.
- **Parameters**:
  - `observation_parameters`: A dictionary of user-specified parameters that outline the observation criteria and data collection methods.
- **Returns**: An observational report summarizing the activities, decisions, and interactions of the agents.
